# BrandMeasures

When a new product is to be lunched in the market it is prefereable to understand how to market it. For this purpose we may hand out samples of the product to people and then contact them to ask their reviews on whether they liked it, suggestions, current favorite brands, etc,. This is audio information so, we need to first extract these answers by users in textual format but it is hard to do it manually.

This is where our system comes in. The system can take any audio file of such a conversation and extract the reviews by users for each of those questions.

## Description

- The audio files have to uploaded on the system.
- The audio is then split based on pauses in speech
- Then the files are converted to text.
- Now, the texts are passed through the spell corrector
- The texts are saved and can be exported for analysis

## Aim / Goal

- To extract product reviews from audio files.

## Skillset

- Python programming.
- Data Validation
- Data preprocessing
- feature engineering
- logging
- regex
- model deployment

## What i Learnt

- Industry standard OOP's based approach
- logging.
- Different libraries and techniques available to process text and audio
- Importance of such systems.
